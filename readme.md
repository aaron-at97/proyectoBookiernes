# JOINT PROJECT - Bookiernes

## Introduction
This project is about developing a software for our
company "Bookiernes S.A". This company has decided to 
hire us because its sales had dropped exponentially 
due to the scarce relationship between the members 
of the company and their lack of communication. 
This problem has generated general discontent 
among writers and readers and our goal is to 
try to change it.

The company has decided to hire us because we 
work computerizing workflows and trying to avoid 
economic losses with the best structured idea and
workspace. Also, we need to centralize 
the workflow, and the communication between all the 
members of this company.
